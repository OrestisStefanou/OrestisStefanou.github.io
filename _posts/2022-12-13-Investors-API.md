As a software engineer who works at a company that provides a platform to invest money in stocks i read the book ‘How to make money in stocks’ by William O'Neil to understand what kind of data we should provide to our clients to help them make better decisions.The book lead me this website https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-tables/ that in my opinion provide really valuable data but since these data are in table format i created an api to provide more flexible querying to these data.
