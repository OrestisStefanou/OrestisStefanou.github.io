description: "An end to end machine learning project to predict and serve stock price predictions"
---
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that will predict if a stock price will be higher or lower six months from the time we request a prediction. After the model development is done we will also create a microservice that will serve the prediction probabilities along with the prediction factors(shap values)
