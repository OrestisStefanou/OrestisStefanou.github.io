Google Drive Service is an api that works on top of Google Drive API to provide simpler endpoints for basic operations like listing the files of a user,downloading and uploading files and handling file permissions

## Who is Google Drive Service for
If you have a service that needs access to your user's google drive or you are just trying to automate some google drive operations, then Google Drive Service is for you

## How to use
Google Drive api uses oauth2 authentication,so in order to get access to your client's google drive you need an access token to perform a request on the userâ€™s behalf.To get an access token we send a url to the user where they have to accept that your service can have access to their google drive account.After the user accepts,google returns to the user an authentication code which the user has to send back to us in order to generate the access token.In the diagram below we can see the authentication flow( 'Requesting Service' is the service that needs to access the google drive of it's users and is using google drive service to achieve that)
